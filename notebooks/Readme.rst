What's this?
------------

This is a repository of "unpublished" notebooks.

Some notebooks will be reasonably clean, some notebooks are for development
or for checking new features or problems with existing code, and might require
a branch of statsmodels. Others are draft versions that haven't made it into
statsmodels yet. Some notebooks start out clean and then detour into some
messy computational or statistical investigation.

The main purpose is for me to collect my notes, and have a location to point to
for features that are not well documented in statsmodels and are clearer here.

Not available. All rights reserved. I don't know.

You can use the code as recipes and to learn from it, but the example collection,
data and explanations are my or somebody else's copyright.
I don't check or make up my mind about it.
Parts that will be moved to statsmodels will become BSD-3 like all of statsmodels.
