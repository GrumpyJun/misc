Wald tests are based on unrestricted parameter which additionally allows to test different hypothesis without estimating the model under different restrictions. An additional advantage of Wald tests is that it is relatively easy to obtain robust covariance matrices, i.e. sandwich covariance of the parameters that are robust to unspecified correlation and heteroscedasticity.\n",

However, in small samples, it is possible that the difference in the objective function has the wrong sign if we use different weight matrices.\n",

Estimating the restricted models can be easier when we want to compute diagnostic tests to check whether the restricted model is correct, but it requires that we estimated each restricted model separately if we test several restrictions, as in the use case for the Wald test that provides p-values and confidence intervals for each parameter. \n",

All three tests are asymptotically equivalent and have the same limiting distribution, with the restriction that J-test or LR test does not apply in all cases for which Wald and score tests are available. Additionally, in many cases there are different ways of calculating the score or wald statistic that are all asymptotically equivalent. However, the tests and versions of the tests have different accuracy in small samples and differ in general in higher order asymptotics. \n",
